# IT-Expenditure-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **IT expenditure** across different business areas, regions, and cost categories using **Power BI**.  
The dashboard provides transparency into **Actual vs. Forecast vs. Planned IT costs**, highlights overspending and underutilization, and supports **strategic budgeting & operational accountability**.

---

## Objectives
- Understand how IT costs are distributed across **functions, regions, and cost elements**  
- Compare **Actual vs. Forecast vs. Plan** expenditure  
- Identify **cost drivers** (e.g., labor, shared services, planning)  
- Highlight areas of **budget misalignment and overspending**  

---

## Data Preparation
- Imported **Excel dataset** into Power BI  
- Standardized field names for consistency  
- Handled **missing values** (blank Actuals/Forecast/Plan fields)  
- Formatted date fields and created **categorical dimensions** (Region, IT Area, Business Unit)  

---

## üìà Key Analysis
- Calculated **total & category-level IT spend** for Actuals, Forecast, and Plan  
- Built **variance measures** using DAX:  
  - `Actual vs. Plan`  
  - `Forecast vs. Plan`  
  - `Actual vs. Forecast`  
- Analyzed **spending trends over time** and across **regions/IT areas**  

---

## Drilldowns
- Segmented costs by:  
  - **IT Area**  
  - **Business Area**  
  - **Cost Element Group**  
- Identified departments/regions with highest variance  
- Compared **Internal Labor vs. Shared Services** cost patterns  

---

## Dashboard Features
- **KPI Cards**: Total Actual, Plan, Forecast, Variance %  
- **Trend Analysis**: Line & bar charts for spend comparison  
- **Cost Distribution**: Pie/Tree Map visuals by IT Area & Cost Element  
- **Drilldown Analysis**: Hierarchical view of cost drivers  
- **Interactive Slicers**: Filter by Region, Business Unit, IT Area, Month-Year
